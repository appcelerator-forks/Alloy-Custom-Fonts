Applification Quick Tip: Alloy Custom Fonts
===========================================

This repo uses [Titanium Appcelerator Alloy](https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy), the official MVC framework for Titanium. 

If you are new to Alloy head over to the [docs on Github](https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/master/docs) to get up to speed. 

Key points: 

	1. Place your custom font in app / assets folder
	2. Ensure you have an Info.plist file in the root of your project, and create an entry with the filename of your custom font
	3. In your .tss style sheet file add the following the element with your text in:
	font: {fontSize: 24, fontFamily: "Lobster 1.3"}
